# About me

Photography is more than just images—it’s a way of seeing the world. Through my lens, I capture emotions, connections, and the beauty of the fleeting moment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hello, 
## I’m Alex Carter

I’m Alex Carter, a photographer specializing in landscape, portrait, and street photography. My journey began over a decade ago when I picked up my first camera and discovered a passion for storytelling through visuals. Whether I’m capturing the raw energy of a city street, the tranquility of a mountain sunrise, or the depth of a person’s gaze, my goal is always the same—to create timeless images that resonate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My Photography Journey
From my early days exploring photography as a creative outlet to being published in international magazines and exhibitions, my work has evolved into a deeply personal form of storytelling. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with incredible people, brands, and artists to create compelling imagery that speaks beyond words.

Some of my highlights include:
Featured in: National Geographic, Vogue, and Time Magazine
Exhibitions: Showcased in galleries in New York, London, and Tokyo
Collaborations: Worked with brands, models, and agencies worldwide

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My Approach & Philosophy
Photography is about emotion, light, and connection. My approach blends technical precision with artistic vision, ensuring that every shot is meaningful and visually captivating. I believe in using natural light whenever possible to create authentic, cinematic compositions that feel real and immersive.

I strive to:
Capture raw, unfiltered emotions
Tell a compelling story through every frame
Create visuals that leave a lasting impression

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Behind the Scenes

Every great photograph starts with a vision, but the magic happens in the process—from scouting locations to finding the perfect light and moment.

If you’d like to work together, collaborate, or simply talk photography, I’d love to hear from you!
